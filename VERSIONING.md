# Versioning Strategy - Berjaya WMS React

## 🎯 Version Philosophy

This project follows **semantic versioning** with **stable fallback points** to ensure you can always return to a working state.

## 📋 Version History

### **v1.0.0 - Foundation Release** ⭐ **STABLE FALLBACK POINT**
- **Date**: August 18, 2025
- **Status**: ✅ STABLE - Always safe to return to this version
- **Features**:
  - Complete React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS architecture
  - Firebase Google OAuth authentication
  - Mobile-first responsive design
  - Clean deployment to Firebase hosting
- **Live URL**: https://berjaya-autotech-4b4f4.web.app
- **GitHub Tag**: `v1.0.0`

## 🔄 How to Fall Back to Any Version

### **Return to v1.0.0 (Foundation)**:
```bash
# Option 1: Check out the tagged version
git checkout v1.0.0

# Option 2: Create a new branch from v1.0.0
git checkout -b fallback-to-v1.0.0 v1.0.0

# Option 3: Reset main branch to v1.0.0 (DESTRUCTIVE - lose recent changes)
git reset --hard v1.0.0
```

### **Deploy Any Version**:
```bash
# After checking out any version:
npm install
npm run build
firebase deploy --only hosting:berjaya-autotech-4b4f4
```

## 📈 Planned Version Roadmap

### **v1.1.0 - Role Selection** (Next)
- Add role selection screen (Logistics, Production, Manager)
- User navigation between sections
- Role-based UI differences

### **v1.2.0 - Basic Inventory**
- Logistics inventory counting interface
- Simple item entry and submission
- Mobile-optimized forms

### **v1.3.0 - Production Zones**
- Production zone selection
- Zone-specific inventory management
- Production workflow implementation

### **v2.0.0 - Full Feature Parity**
- Complete feature parity with original JavaScript version
- Manager dashboard
- Transaction management
- BOM operations

## 🛡️ Safety Guidelines

### **When to Create New Versions**:
1. **Major Features**: New main functionality (role selection, inventory, etc.)
2. **Stable Milestones**: When app reaches a stable, testable state
3. **Before Risky Changes**: Before attempting complex refactoring
4. **Production Deployments**: Before deploying significant changes

### **Version Safety Rules**:
- ✅ **Always test locally** before creating a version tag
- ✅ **Deploy and verify** the live site works before tagging
- ✅ **Document what changed** in the tag message
- ✅ **Keep v1.0.0 as emergency fallback** - never delete this tag

### **Emergency Fallback Process**:
If new features break the application:
1. **Immediate**: `git checkout v1.0.0`
2. **Deploy safe version**: `npm run build && firebase deploy`
3. **Investigate**: Fix issues in a separate branch
4. **Return**: Only merge back when issues are resolved

## 🎯 Current Development Status

- **Current Version**: v1.0.0 (Foundation)
- **Next Target**: v1.1.0 (Role Selection)
- **Stable Fallback**: v1.0.0 ⭐
- **Live Site**: Always matches latest deployed version

## 📚 Version Command Reference

```bash
# See all versions
git tag -l

# See current version
git describe --tags

# Create new version
git tag -a v1.1.0 -m "Version 1.1.0: Role Selection Feature"
git push origin v1.1.0

# Check out specific version
git checkout v1.0.0

# Return to latest development
git checkout main

# Compare versions
git diff v1.0.0..main
```

## 🎉 Benefits of This Approach

1. **Risk-Free Development**: Always have a working version to fall back to
2. **Clear Progress Tracking**: Each version represents a milestone
3. **Easy Collaboration**: Team members can work on specific versions
4. **Production Safety**: Never deploy broken code
5. **User Confidence**: Always have a stable system for warehouse workers

**Remember**: v1.0.0 is your safety net. No matter what happens with future development, you can always return to this working foundation! 🛡️
