Documentation Archive

This project previously kept several large, internal working notes at the repository root. To keep the root tidy, we archived them. If you need to reference the original content, use Git history or the snapshot branch created before cleanup.

Where to find originals:
- Git branch: `snapshot/2025-10-03` (created before cleanup)
- Git history on `main` (prior to this cleanup commit)

Archived files (removed from repo root):
- CLAUDE.md — migration/assistant notes
- GEMINI.md — assistant integration notes
- SCANNER_TEST_PLAN.md — early scanner test plan draft (superseded by code/tests)
- DEPLOY_DEV.md — ad-hoc dev deploy notes (Firebase Hosting CLI)

Rationale:
- Reduce noise at the root of the project
- Prevent confusion with outdated or exploratory docs
- Encourage relying on inline code docs, README, and up-to-date service/component files

If any of these should be restored to an official docs section, open an issue or PR with the proposed scope and audience.
