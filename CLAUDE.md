# CLAUDE.md - React Migration Project

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with the Berjaya WMS React project.

## üéØ PROJECT PHILOSOPHY - CRITICAL

**USER PRIORITY: MAINTAINABILITY ABOVE ALL ELSE**

The user has explicitly stated that **maintainability is the highest priority**. Previous vanilla JavaScript implementation became unmaintainable with:
- 145+ event listeners across 11 files
- Complex scope management issues
- Firebase integration problems
- "Another explosion" of complexity

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL RULE: Every decision must prioritize long-term maintainability over short-term features.**

## üìã Project Overview

**Current Status**: v2.1.1 - SKU Synchronization Fix (deployed August 19, 2025)
**IMPORTANT**: Read Eugene_note.md first! Contains complete roadmap and vision.
- **Original Problem**: Complex event management, scope issues, Firebase integration chaos
- **Solution**: Clean React architecture with TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **Result**: Live at https://berjaya-autotech-4b4f4.web.app
- **GitHub**: https://github.com/Chyi1214/berjaya-wms-react.git
- **Last Commit**: 5da071c (v2.1.1: Fix version number display + SKU synchronization)
- **Codebase Size**: 44 files, 10,867 lines of TypeScript/React code

### Migration Success Metrics
‚úÖ **Event Management**: React handles all DOM events automatically - no manual cleanup needed
‚úÖ **Scope Issues**: Eliminated through React component isolation
‚úÖ **Firebase Integration**: Clean service layer with proper error handling
‚úÖ **Mobile Experience**: Mobile-first Tailwind CSS design
‚úÖ **Developer Experience**: TypeScript catches errors, hot reloading, clear component structure

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL DEPLOYMENT ISSUE

### Bundle Size Crisis - URGENT
**Problem**: Main JavaScript bundle is 751 KB, deployment times 3+ minutes
**Current Status**: ManagerView.tsx is 960 lines (BLOATED!)
**Future Risk**: Scanner integration will add significant complexity
**Impact**: Blocking rapid development and testing cycles

### CRITICAL: Code Splitting Before Scanner Work
**Must implement before v2.2.0 scanner integration**:
1. **Split ManagerView.tsx (960 lines)** ‚Üí 4-5 smaller components  
2. **Lazy Load Dialogs**: ItemManagementDialog, CSVImportDialog with React.lazy()
3. **Component Structure**: Overview, Inventory, Transactions, ItemMaster as separate files
4. **Expected Results**: Main bundle ~300-400 KB, faster deployments <1 minute

**Next Session Priority**: Code splitting BEFORE scanner features

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Principles - MAINTAINABILITY FOCUSED

### 1. **Component Isolation**
- Each component is self-contained
- No shared global state unless absolutely necessary
- Clear props and interfaces for all data flow
- Components handle their own lifecycle and cleanup

### 2. **Single Responsibility**
- Each file has ONE clear purpose
- Services handle data operations
- Components handle UI rendering
- Contexts handle shared state
- No "kitchen sink" files

### 3. **Type Safety First**
- TypeScript for all code
- Clear interfaces for all data structures
- No `any` types unless unavoidable
- Props interfaces for all components

### 4. **Predictable State Management**
- React Context for global state (auth, inventory)
- Local state for component-specific data
- No complex state management libraries unless project grows significantly
- Clear data flow: Props down, events up

### 5. **Clean Dependencies**
- Minimal external libraries
- Each dependency must have clear justification
- Regular dependency audits
- No "just in case" libraries

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

### Core Technologies
- **React 18**: UI library with hooks and modern patterns
- **TypeScript**: Type safety and better developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling (no CSS scope issues)
- **Vite**: Fast development and building
- **Firebase**: Authentication and database (when needed)

### Development Tools
- **ESLint**: Code quality enforcement
- **Hot Module Reloading**: Fast development feedback
- **Source Maps**: Easy debugging in production

### Deployment
- **Firebase Hosting**: Deployed to `berjaya-autotech-4b4f4` site
- **Build Process**: `npm run build` ‚Üí `firebase deploy --only hosting:berjaya-autotech-4b4f4`

## üö® MAINTAINABILITY RULES

### When Adding New Features:

1. **Ask First**: Does this feature increase or decrease maintainability?

2. **Component Design**:
   - Can this component be understood in isolation?
   - Does it have a single, clear responsibility?
   - Are the props interface clear and minimal?
   - Can it be easily tested?

3. **State Management**:
   - Is this state truly global or can it be local?
   - Does the data flow remain predictable?
   - Can I trace where this state comes from and where it goes?

4. **Dependencies**:
   - Do we absolutely need this new library?
   - Does it solve a real problem or just add convenience?
   - Will this library still be maintained in 2 years?

5. **Code Patterns**:
   - Is this pattern consistent with the rest of the codebase?
   - Will new developers understand this easily?
   - Am I creating hidden complexity?

### Forbidden Patterns (Lessons from Original Codebase):

‚ùå **Global event listeners** - Use React event handlers only
‚ùå **Manual DOM manipulation** - Let React handle the DOM
‚ùå **Shared mutable state** - Use immutable patterns
‚ùå **Deeply nested callbacks** - Use async/await and hooks
‚ùå **Monolithic components** - Break down into smaller pieces
‚ùå **Implicit dependencies** - Make all dependencies explicit in props/context

## üéØ Feature Development Guidelines

### Current Features (Completed):
‚úÖ **Authentication**: Google OAuth via Firebase
‚úÖ **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first Tailwind CSS
‚úÖ **Error Handling**: Graceful error states and loading indicators
‚úÖ **Deployment**: Automated build and deploy to Firebase

### Next Features (Priority Order):
1. **Role Selection**: Simple component with clear navigation
2. **Inventory Counting**: Form with validation, mobile-optimized
3. **Manager Dashboard**: Data tables with clear data flow
4. **Transaction Management**: Simple CRUD operations
5. **BOM Operations**: CSV import/export with clear error handling

### Development Process:
1. **Design the component interface first** (props, state, events)
2. **Create TypeScript interfaces** for all data
3. **Build the component in isolation** (can be tested independently)
4. **Integrate with existing app** (minimal changes to other components)
5. **Test on mobile devices** (real phones, not just browser dev tools)
6. **Deploy and validate** (ensure no regressions)

## üîß Common Tasks

### Adding a New Feature:
```bash
# 1. Create component with TypeScript
# 2. Add types to src/types/index.ts
# 3. Test locally: npm run dev
# 4. Build: npm run build
# 5. Deploy: firebase deploy --only hosting:berjaya-autotech-4b4f4
```

### Debugging Issues:
- Check browser console for TypeScript errors
- Use React DevTools for component state
- Check Firebase console for authentication issues
- Verify mobile responsiveness on actual devices

### Performance Optimization:
- Use React.memo() for expensive components
- Implement useCallback() for event handlers passed as props
- Add useMemo() for expensive calculations
- Lazy load components if bundle gets large

## üö® Emergency Maintainability Checklist

If the codebase starts feeling complex again, ask:

1. **Can I understand each component in 5 minutes?**
2. **Can I predict what happens when I change this code?**
3. **Are there more than 3 levels of nested callbacks/promises?**
4. **Do I need to understand other files to work on this component?**
5. **Would a new developer be productive in this codebase in a day?**

If any answer is "No", **STOP** and refactor before adding more features.

## üéØ Priority for Next Session - Scanner Preparation

### URGENT (Must Complete Before Scanner Work):
1. **CRITICAL**: Split ManagerView.tsx (960 lines) into 4-5 components
2. **CRITICAL**: Implement React.lazy() for ItemManagementDialog, CSVImportDialog
3. **CRITICAL**: Test bundle size reduction and deployment speed
4. **CRITICAL**: Comprehensive testing of all existing functions

### Scanner Integration Planning (v2.2.0):
1. **Research**: Barcode scanning libraries (QuaggaJS, ZXing, etc.)
2. **Prototype**: Basic camera-based scanning proof of concept
3. **Integration**: Scanner with Item Master lookup
4. **Mobile**: Optimize for handheld scanner devices
5. **Offline**: Design offline-first scanning workflow

### Current System Readiness:
- ‚úÖ Item Master catalog with SKU system (F001, B001, E001 patterns)
- ‚úÖ BOM management for complex assemblies
- ‚úÖ Multi-zone inventory tracking
- ‚úÖ Transaction system with audit trail
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Bundle size blocking rapid development
- ‚ö†Ô∏è All functions need comprehensive testing
- ‚ùå Scanner integration not started

## üìù Important Context

- **User Philosophy**: "We are at best half way" - many more features coming
- **Bundle Crisis**: 722 KB now, could reach 1.5-2 MB without optimization
- **Deployment Issues**: Currently times out but succeeds in background
- **Maintainability Focus**: User values simple solutions over complex ones
- **BOM Complexity**: Next autocomplete component will be most complex part

---

**Remember: Every line of code is a liability. Bundle size is now blocking rapid development. Scanner integration will be complex - we MUST have a solid, well-tested foundation first. Fix technical debt and complete testing BEFORE scanner work. Maintainability is not optional - it's the difference between a successful scanner implementation and "another explosion".**
